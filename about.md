<p>
  Cambridge, UK-based software guy - always interested in technology and until recently, leading the Camera team at Amazon/Ring. I'm frequently found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, on our small yacht, riding the great trails and paths on the island, or in the great bars and restaurants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowes">Cowes</a>.
