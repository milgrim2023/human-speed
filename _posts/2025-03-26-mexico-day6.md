Woke at 0700 after 8.5hrs sleep. The sun is shining and Dewey is making coffee. I feel goddamn fantastic! Elpie makes a call home to talk to Ed who's struggling to change his tickets to Malaysia to the right name - he'd given Eddie as his first name. I hope he can get it changed, the booking agent want him to cancel and re-book, but he'd only get 25% of the money back from cancelling and likely the next flight would be 4x more expensive.

A few navigation sounds in the harbour prompted a discussion of what they mean. One long - intention to leave the dock, 3 short - reversing out, 5 short - what the fuck are you doing! 

We went over to see Anders' boat. He has an incredibly well built ex-ocean racer. An engine room you could host a party in, with a workbench on one side and a comprehensive electric board on the other. 1200Ah of AGM batteries paired with 4 circuits of solar. Incredible engineering on both the keel stepped mast and the rudder post (which is thicker than the proverbial baby, never mind it's arm.) Tanks for water and diesel in the centre of the boat, under the saloon. Talking of the saloon, there's 6ft 7in of head clearance all the way through and it's bright and airy due to the side windows. It's a blade rudder and bolt on keel, the only trade offs on an otherwise bombproof boat. Anders rigged a system using spare halyards, that allows the enormous 135% Genoa to be tacked without tangling the sheets on hatches or the 8-person liferaft. A modification that was added after nearly losing the liferaft after catching said sheets as the power in the sail snapped the webbing attaching the raft to the deck.

Anders is a force of nature, incredibly knowledgeable about his boat, and the diesel engine in particular. Always with a story to tell or a description of the boat systems. He's talking to a few bands to see if they want to tour by sailboat, such a cool idea and he has the boat to do it. He has great stickers with a Sasquatch with his face. A perfect match for his wild beard and hair.

The star of the show for me though, was Mookie. Such a gentle giant that loves a cuddle. Always reaching out to touch someone with a gentle paw if he's not being cuddled. Always interested in what's happening and follows the group around, afraid of missing out. He looks like a very big golden Labrador but is a crazy cross of larger breeds. Very quiet too, unlike some of the other dogs in the anchorage. I came back to Lintika smelling of dog and covered in his white hair.

At 1055 we headed off anchor and out into the bay for some fresher water and to get some breeze in the hottest part of the day. Elpie did the engine checks (WOBBLE) and found an errant bolt that was lost in yesterday's water pump replacement. As Brady says, "the bilge provides".

She then took Lintika off anchor and out into the bay. I'm so proud of her gaining the confidence in all this, and am staying out of the way to give her space to learn. She motored all the way to our destination, and with encouragement from Brady to 'take it slow and breath' got us back on anchor.

Despite the noise at this anchorage, I love the part of Mexico we've explored. The nature, the colour and sounds. The friendliness of the people, the mezcal, the fact the equivalent of our common seagull is the pelican! 



Brady had been defrosting the last of the Mahi we bought on Day 1 for lunch. He puts on the Magma (bbq on the pushpit) and preps the goodness.
