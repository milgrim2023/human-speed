Well, that's it. I've officially retired. No more commutes, meetings, reviews, emails...well maybe emails.

I'm writing this from a coffee shop, [Happy Bones](https://happybonescoffee.co.uk/) on a Tuesday afternoon in London. I'm killing time before heading to a talk on "How AI can (maybe) fix the government". Just for interest and education, no immediate purpose but maybe a chance to form a connection to something in the future. Who knows?

What's next? A few weeks of settling into new routines. Building more time for fitness, sorting out the houses, traveling to the IoW and going sailing. Then we've got a sailing vacation in Mexico at the end of March which will give me some more time to think. For now though, no concrete plans and I'm liking that as we come into the Spring with its lighter mornings and evenings. It feels like change, the good kind.
