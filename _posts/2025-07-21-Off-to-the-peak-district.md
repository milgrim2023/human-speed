We came up North to see Billie Eilish at the Co-op Live. The concert was great and Billie is such a talent - even if there's some more 'club' songs I don't particularly enjoy.

We came up by train as I planned to stay with my Dad and then go to the Peak District to do some bike packing. Our little Fiat e500 isn't big enough to carry the bike so train it was (my preferred way of traveling anyway.) The trip up was fine; but long and hot as there was no air conditioning on the train from Ely to Manchester.

Anyway, enough of the prelude. I got the train again to Manchester Piccadilly, then to Hathersage where I went to the awesome Alpkit store and picked up a new bike-packing tent. I'd stupidly left my Big Agnes Copper Spur at home after getting distracted while packing.  I had lunch at Coleman's Deli. Fantastic service, I was greeted by Charlotte who called me 'duck' and with a great smile. I had a frankly. amazing Tuna Jalapeño sandwich, the mix of tuna mayonnaise, jalapeño and gherkins was marvelous.

After eating and visiting the bathroom, it was time to cycle to my campsite at Hadden Grove Campsite in Over Hadden. I checked the route on Google Maps. 1hr39mins but very road based, then I tried Komoot, 2hrs5mins but it looked a lot quieter and found some off road bits too.

As I was cycling through beautiful, but steep and long (at least for this Cambridge-based cyclist - thank goodness I'm on my e-gravel Grizl:On) I was reminded of the countryside where I grew up, the other side of Manchester for sure, but still the rolling green hills. stone walls, stone build buildings, and the rain, god the rain. Not only that the thunder started, closer than I've been to it in years, it would crack in one location then reflect in the hills. Very ominous and dramatic but I didn't see any lightning and as I got close to the campsite it stopped.

Reception was closed but I called Amy (whose number was on the door) and she guided me over the phone to the multiple fields and offered to come and open the shop if I needed anything. Finding a pitch was relatively easy, there was lots of space but finding somewhere that would be sheltered from any wind that picked up was made harder by the presence of a group playing loud music. I'm clearly getting old - that was annoying to me and I picked a perhaps non-optimal spot at a suitable distance away. In the end they quietened down and perhaps I could have gone closer to the perfect spot. I'm here for 3 nights, let's see how that plays out.

Anyway, tent pitched, I decided it was time to find some food and beer. Thankfully I had signal and Google Maps was able to find the nearest shop. I decided to turn off my electric assist for the 4-mile journey and mostly made it unassisted but had to turn it on a couple of times to not arrive exhausted - and overly sweaty.

Aldi provided a few easily camp-cookable meals, fruit, some bad instant coffee for the morning and a bottle of Argentinian Malbec. That acquire I rode further in to Bakewell and had nachos, a thirst quenching cider, and a couple of spicy margaritas at the Woodyard.. I fancied another more basic pub drink and cycled to The Peacock. I got there, acquired a cider then realised I'd left my coat at the Woodyard. Quickly drank up and then cycled back to the tent.

It was raining for a good while but cleared up enough for me to write this blog. ~~I'll add photos when I have better service and more time.~~ I've made it to 2200 which is late for cruisers and campers. Good night!
