Today was a transition day. From my campsite in the Peak District, across to near Knutsford, the halfway point to the Wirral where my brother's wedding is. The route is fairly easy, hilly as you'd expect in the Peaks but then long downhill miles to the new campsite.

I got up about 0800, a coat sleeve over my eyes improvising as a sleep mask to prevent the light disturbing me too much after a 0400 toilet trip. The unforecast rain overnight delayed my start a little as I tried to get as much water off as possible. I still had a damp tent, and some wet clothes and towel with which to contend but managed to strap them outside of my packs to avoid getting everything wet.

It wasn't too long before I got under way though and I stopped at the first place I could get breakfast. This turned out to be the [Old Smithy in Monyash][smithy]. I opted for the filter coffee (surprisingly good) and an egg bap (Northern term – and very welcome) and then quickly got on my way again.

The first 20km or so were hilly, but beautiful. The roads were quiet for the most part but there were a few fast and busy roads to cross. Nothing too unpleasant though.

Komoot had done a good job with routing for the most part but at one stage sent me up a track I'd have struggled to do on a mountain bike. Fortunately the assisted walk feature did its job and I struggled through the few hundred meters of the trail before getting back on to roads.

The crank seems to be surviving so far, and after the hills of the Peaks, the fast descents followed by a steady drop in altitude made for much faster progress. I'd used the assistance only on the steeper climbs and ended with 33% battery remaining which should give me 40km tomorrow. This should be enough to get to the hotel as the route is flat. Hopefully there's not a headwind which would make that more challenging!

At lunchtime, I stopped for food at a pub a couple of miles from Macclesfield. A cider, a coke and the weirdest fish tacos I've ever had, provided refreshment. The fish was too oversized to make the tacos fold and eat in the normal way. The salad and sauce dressings a little bland for my tastes. Despite the odd tacos, after the hills, this was a very welcome stop, and the staff/owner were super friendly. Interestingly the pub was busy for a Thursday lunchtime, and all of the customers seemed to be regulars, having good conversations with the team. That's nice to see, too many pubs these days are dead during the week.

As mentioned previously, after the hills the roads were fast flowing, and for the most part, quiet National Cycle Network routes. The folk at Sustrans who maintain these routes – not the government! – are absolute legends.

As I neared the campsite the sun came out and for the last 45mins or so I found myself cycling in the sun which was a very welcome change. Pulling in to [Greenfield's Campsite][green] just before 1500 I found a nice open field with a couple of posh wooden huts at the entrance to a lovely big field with individual pitches set out. Each pitch has a circular section with log seats and a brick area for fires. The toilets and showers are nicely done, with self-built(?) huts, proper toilets and showers. There are only a couple of each but it's very cute. The only downside, shared by many campsites, is the road noise coming from the M6 which isn't too far away. It doesn't bother me too much at a site like this since I wear headphones to sleep. If I was staying longer, and spending time at camp during the day it might.

After setting up camp I went in search of the local shop. That was easy to find and I picked up some drinks and snacks for later, and also a pot of pesto to go with the last of the pasta I bought. I did visit the pub after that and thought about eating there but decided against it having already had pub food once today.

I had a shower and then started cooking food. As I was cooking the campsite owner, Andrew, came over with some marshmallows and sticks. I of course asked for some firewood. I'd have asked for the wood anyway but the marshmallows sealed the deal. I chatted with Andrew for a bit, periodically stopping the food from boiling over, and then said goodbye.

The campsite is quiet tonight. I'm the only camper at the moment. It's just me and Albie the Tup watching the sun go down.

After washing up, I spent some time just chilling and catching up with Mastodon and the news. Then I lit the fire and settled down to roasting marshmallows and watching the flames. The ride was tough in parts but I feel good having made 60km/40 miles. I've earned the marshmallows this week!
