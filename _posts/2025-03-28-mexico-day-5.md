My 0000-0200 shift passed without drama. The sky's were dark and my vision a little sleep blurred but still able to make out a tiny bit of bioluminescence in the boat's wake. Handed back over to Elpie and went to bed.

Woke at 0556 and got up. Not my shift but we are about an hour and 20 minutes from Mazatlán. The weather is eerily foggy. 

Current location: 23°4.963'N • 106°23.996'W

Went to put coffee on, only to find the water pressure is poor. Plenty of water in the tank and the switch is on Looks like we'll have a little more boat maintenance when we get in. I was still able to make a welcome coffee though. I'm super hungry this morning, very strange. I munch on cashews and fruit.

We start to see Mazatlán through the mist around 0645, the sun is starting to burn through.

We come into port and anchor smoothly. It's a little strange to see so many boats and buildings on the shore after so many days at sea and the serenity of Isabel. 

Anchored : 23°10.992'N • 106°25.276'W 

I help Brady retrieve the spare pump which involves sitting on the folded mattress in the fore cabin, while Brady wrestles out the spinnaker which covers everything else. We find the pump and rearrange the storage under the bed. Making it easier to extract the spinnaker next time. As we do this Dewey and Jim remove the old pump, and then refit the new one. All good, but the new one is 60psi rather than 30psi and there's a little, short-lived, concern that this might cause leaks. It doesn't, but the sound is not as pleasant as the old pump. First-world problems. 

A [Cruisers Academy](https://www.cruisersacademy.com/) graduate, Anders, stops by with his dog Mookie. Anders met Brady and Blue by inviting them to his free 4-day music festival. He tells us it has a culture of excessive giving - everyone who comes brings something to share. He sailed his 63ft(!) ketch down here through some brutal weather and regaled us with the intricate detail of his debugging of the cooling system in his engine. That man can tell a story! We're going to visit him tomorrow for morning coffee.
