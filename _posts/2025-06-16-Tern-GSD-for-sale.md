## Time to say goodbye
Well, it's time to say goodbye to my beloved Tern GSD. The trusty GSD helped me get to work ([12 miles each way]({{site-url}}/blog/2025/01/favourite-work/)) a few times a week, always within +/- 5 minutes. Thanks to the electric motor, this was without regard to wind direction, my fitness, or how tired I was that day.

The Tern competes extremely well in the [#carryshitolympics](https://www.mas.to/tags/carryshitolympics). With the big bucket bags the bike is incredibly easy to load, and simple to keep contents dry/safe when the roll-top is engaged. The party trick of standing upright for storage saved space in the garage, and on the train it is only as long as a normal bike.  Maintenance has been easy with the belt drive and Enviolo hub gear. 

Wait, do I really want to sell this magnificent machine? [\*](#yes)

Enough of the eulogy, here are the details. There are photos below, but if you want to zoom in to higher resolution images then please find them [here][photos]. 

With the dual batteries and other accessories I'm looking for ~Â£3750 and am open to offers from families who can make good use of a GSD. 

## 2023 Tern GSD S00

- Low-maintenance Enviolo SP hub with Gates belt drive, twist grip gear shift 
- Bosch Cargoline motor (85nm of torque, 400% support)
    - walk assist
- 2x 500Wh batteries for a total of 1000Wh
    - I ride in Sport mostly and get 60-70 miles between charges, but this will depend on your terrain (and effort :-) ).  
- Additional Bosch fast charger
    - Leave one where you might need it if you find you need a bit more juice, or charge both batteries at the same time. 
- Tern Valo Direct, 190 lumen front light
    - always on rear light with brake light feature
- Atlas locking stand (with the extenders making it very stable)
- Front suspension 
- Folding handlebars for storage
- Full mudguards front and rear, with covered drivetrain
- Quickly adjusts for riders of 150cm to 195cm 
    - double segment seatpost, and cleverly adjusting handlebar height.
- Four piston Magura MT5 hydraulic brakes with 180mm rotors
- Abus wheel lock - same keys as the batteries
- Tested capacity load of 200kg - including bike, accessories and riders 
    - Note: all that strength does come with a weight penalty of around ~35kg, but with a little thought and care definitely manageable.  
- Accessories 
    - Transporteur Rack Front
    - Tern GSD Shortbed Tray Rear (not fitted)
    - Tern GSD Cargo Hold 52 Panniers
    - Sidekick Doublewide Decks
    - Tern GSD Seat Pad (not fitted in the photos)
    - The aforementioned extenders for the Atlas locking stand

4685 miles on the clock, the service indicator is on, the last service was ~200 miles ago - nothing for this bike.

Upgraded shifter with the cute indicator, see this [video][video] for a demonstration (newer version).

A view of the cockpit. The light is great to have always on the bike. Those levers you can see allow the bars to rotate backwards and forwards in an arc to fit taller or shorter people, or just for comfort.

*\* yes, I've exceeded even my n+1 quota and now have a lovely non-electric Omnium which definitely takes more space and effort*
